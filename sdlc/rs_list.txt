Upon starting the haven service, an attempt shall be made to perform the following:
(a) initialize a connection to VertexAI using the project ID and location specified in the project configuration file
(b) load a GenerativeModel model definition from public_data/model_definition.txt
(c) load a system prompt from public_data/system_prompt.txt
(d) initialize a GenerativeModel object using the model definition loaded in (b), the system prompt loaded in (c), and the safety settings specified in the project configuration file
If any step above fails, the haven service shall log a critical failure and abort its startup process.

If a GenerativeModel instance can be successfully created, the haven service shall initialize a persistent Haven object and serve it via a BaseManager on port 50000 for remote access by the phoenix service.

The haven shall contain a module-level 'live_chat_sessions' dictionary storing ordered lists of Content objects (user and model turns) keyed by session name.

The Haven class shall expose a get_or_create_session method 

The Haven class shall expose a send_message method which serves as the sole mediator of communication between the user and agent. 

Upon receiving a session name and user prompt, the send_message method shall
(a) convert the user prompt into a Content object and append it to the history of the specified agent
(b) send the updated history to the agent and receive the agent's response
(c) convert the agent response into a Content object and append it to its history
(d) return the agent response to the caller

The Haven class shall expose a list_sessions method which returns a list of the names of all currently live sessions.

The Haven class shall expose a delete_session method which deletes a session from the live dictionary.

The Haven class shall expose a has_session method which returns True if a session exists in the haven or False otherwise. 

The Haven class shall expose a get_trace_log method which returns the global trace log from the haven process.












Claude:
Haven Service Requirements Specification
Purpose Statement
The Haven service shall function as a persistent, stateful backend service responsible for managing AI model instances and chat session histories, ensuring continuity of conversational context across main application lifecycle events.
Mandatory Initialization Sequence
The Haven service MUST execute the following initialization steps in order upon startup:

Vertex AI Connection Establishment: Establish connection to Google Vertex AI using project credentials specified in the configuration module
Model Definition Loading: Load the generative model specification from public_data/model_definition.txt
System Prompt Loading: Load the system instruction set from public_data/system_prompt.txt
Model Instance Creation: Instantiate a GenerativeModel object using the loaded model definition, system prompt, and safety configuration parameters

CRITICAL FAILURE HANDLING: If any initialization step fails, the Haven service SHALL log a critical error message and MUST abort the startup process immediately. No partial initialization states are permitted.
Service Availability Requirements
Upon successful model initialization, the Haven service SHALL:

Instantiate a persistent Haven object
Expose the Haven instance via BaseManager on the designated port
Maintain continuous availability for remote procedure calls from the Phoenix service

Core Data Management
The Haven service MUST maintain a module-level dictionary (live_chat_sessions) that:

Uses session names as unique identifiers (keys)
Stores ordered collections of Content objects representing complete conversational histories
Preserves chronological ordering of user and model interactions
Maintains data integrity across all operations

Mandatory API Surface
The Haven class SHALL expose the following methods with non-negotiable behavior:
get_or_create_session(session_name, history_dicts) -> bool

MUST retrieve existing session history if present
MUST create new session with provided history if not present
SHALL return boolean confirmation of operation success

send_message(session_name, prompt) -> dict

SHALL serve as the exclusive communication gateway between users and the AI model
MUST execute the following atomic sequence:

Convert user prompt to Content object and append to session history
Submit complete updated history to the AI model
Capture model response and convert to Content object
Append model response to session history
Return response payload to caller


SHALL return structured response with status and content fields

list_sessions() -> List[str]

MUST return complete list of all active session identifiers
SHALL reflect real-time state of live sessions

delete_session(session_name) -> dict

MUST permanently remove specified session from active memory
SHALL return operation status confirmation

has_session(session_name) -> bool

MUST return definitive boolean indicating session existence
SHALL provide reliable session state verification

get_trace_log() -> Any

MUST return complete execution trace log from the Haven process
SHALL support debugging and system monitoring requirements

Non-Negotiable Operational Constraints

The Haven service SHALL NOT be restarted during normal Phoenix application lifecycle events
All session data MUST persist in memory for the duration of the Haven process lifetime
The service SHALL maintain thread-safe operations for concurrent access
Model responses MUST be captured and stored before being returned to prevent data loss
